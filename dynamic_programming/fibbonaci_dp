/*
Arisen in vain to a life,
Bleeding inner to suffer with time.
Endlessly lost and still searching
For something, someday.
 
Obsession & deceit
To burn a mark for a lifetime.
Boundaries to brake,
Reached from the edge of time.
To rebuild the past
For something that will everlast.
Just searching for to find itself
In still-motion.
 
For to hope,
Whenever to find a closure,
Find itself in still-motion..
 
Get closer,
Closer to your own faith.
 
Serve the frail mind,
Escape through the lifetime
To glance for your dismal youth.
 
Get closer,
Closer to your own faith.
